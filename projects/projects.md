My current project is Pneumatic.IO. The docs are [here](/pneumatic).

I'd love to have expert help with Pneumatic.IO. I have [some thoughts](http://pneumatic.io/pneumatic/getting-involved.html) on contributions that might be especially helpful, but if you have some ideas on how I might help, [let me know](http://www.surgingsystems.com/contact).

If you're interested in checking it out, [git the fork over here](https://github.com/objectuser/pneumatic)!
