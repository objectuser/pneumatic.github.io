This post is a follow-up to the [Vagrant]({% post_url 2015-03-21-configuration-management %}) post where I talked about setting up Vagrant with MySQL. I followed up that post talking about provisioning with [Puppet]({% post_url 2015-03-28-puppet %}) and [Salt]({% post_url 2015-04-04-salt %}).

In this post, I'll talk about using the [Ansible provisioner](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/provisioning/ansible.html). [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/home), like Salt, uses a YAML-based language, with a slightly different take.

Ansible's approach comes off more like running a script than Salt's approach of setting target states (though Ansible does that too). Ansible made sense to me right away. It has a comparatively simple model, using SSH for communications, rather than the client-server approach of Puppet and Salt. That simplicity is attractive to me as a user.

However, there are always tradeoffs. I've read bits about the Salt minions, for example, being useful for monitoring, gathering statistics on managed components and more. I can see that being very useful.

Ansible worked exactly like I expected it to work. The language is simple and consistent. Some of the documentation uses a `propertyName=propertyValue` style of syntax, which is more concise. However, the typical YAML syntax is always available, which is my preference.

The `Vagrantfile` is what you would expect:

```
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty64"
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 3306, host: 3306

  config.vm.provision "ansible" do |ansible|
    ansible.playbook = "playbook.yml"
  end
end
```

The `playbook.yml` is where the action is. Here's the complete listing:

```
---
- hosts: all
  sudo: true

  vars:
    - login_user: root
    - login_password: root

  tasks:

    - name: install mysql
      apt:
        name: "{{item}}"
        state: latest
      with_items:
        - mysql-server
        - mysql-client
        - python-mysqldb
  
    - name: add mysql user
      mysql_user:
        name: "{{login_user}}"
        password: "{{login_password}}"
        host: "{{item}}"
        priv: "*.*:ALL,GRANT"
        login_user: "{{login_user}}"
        login_password: "{{login_password}}"
        check_implicit_admin: yes
      with_items:
        - '%'
        - localhost
  
    - name: copy the sql config
      copy:
        src: files/dynamic.sql
        dest: /tmp/dynamic.sql
  
    - name: create mysql databases
      mysql_db:
        name: dynamic
        login_user: "{{login_user}}"
        login_password: "{{login_password}}"
        state: present
  
    - name: import schema and data
      mysql_db:
        name: dynamic
        login_user: "{{login_user}}"
        login_password: "{{login_password}}"
        state: import
        target: /tmp/dynamic.sql
  
    - name: copy the mysql config
      copy:
        src: files/my.cnf
        dest: /etc/mysql/my.cnf
      notify: restart mysql

  handlers:
    - name: restart mysql
      service:
        name: mysql
        state: restarted

```

The file starts with declaring that the tasks apply to all hosts (`hosts: all`) and that the tasks should run as root (`sudo: true`).

There are three remaining sections: `vars`, `tasks` and `handlers`. The `vars` are just variables to use in the tasks. The `tasks` represent the work performed. They are executed in order. The `handlers` capture events.

I think the tasks are fairly easy to read.

The handler is triggered using the `notify: restart mysql` command. `restart mysql` is the name of the handler that is invoked. This restarts the MySQL server to ensure changes take effect.

Ansible is fairly quick to provision Vagrant, compared to both Puppet and Salt:

```
real  1m11.119s
user  0m4.373s
sys 0m2.197s
```

The next time up, we have:

```
real  0m21.549s
user  0m3.104s
sys 0m1.271s
```

It's looking like all of the provisioners are about the same on the second start, which might be a function of Vagrant, itself.

## Summary

Using Ansible was much more straight-forward to me than Puppet or Salt. Most things just seemed to work and when they didn't, it was pretty clear why. I also like the simplicity of the Ansible architecture. There are advantages to the client-server approach taken by the other tools, and those may make sense in many situations. But for my current purposes, I'd rather have the Ansible approach.
