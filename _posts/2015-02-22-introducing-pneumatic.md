I have a new open source project that's already live on Github. It's called [Pneumatic.IO](http://pneumatic.io) and I refer to it as a fresh take on ETL and structured IO.

The project page is [here](https://github.com/objectuser/pneumatic) and the reference guide is [here](/pneumatic).

It has a long way to go, but it's progressing nicely.

If you're interested in contributing, I'd appreciate your help. I've put up [some ideas](http://pneumatic.io/pneumatic/getting-involved.html) of what might be useful, but I'm also interested in new ideas, especially from people with experience in ETL and structured IO.
