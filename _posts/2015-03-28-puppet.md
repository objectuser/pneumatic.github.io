This post is a follow-up to the [Vagrant]({% post_url 2015-03-21-configuration-management %}) where I talked about setting up Vagrant with MySQL. In that post, I used the shell provisioning feature of Vagrant to configure MySQL.

In this post, I'll talk about using the [Puppet provisioner](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/provisioning/puppet_apply.html). [Puppet](https://puppetlabs.com/) has two forms: client-server and stand-alone. I'll use the stand-alone form, which uses the [puppet apply](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/3.6.latest/man/apply.html) command.

The `Vagrantfile` for Puppet is very simple:

```
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty64"
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 3306, host: 3306
  config.vm.provision "puppet"
end
```

The forwarded port is for MySQL, and the only other interesting part is specifying the `"puppet"` provisioner. By default, Puppet will look in a directory called `manifests` to find configuration files. The default manifest is `default.pp`.

Other than the manifests, there are a few files that we'll use that are in the `files` sub-directory.

Therefore, the setup looks like this:

```
>ls -l
total 8
-rw-r--r--@ 1 Kevin  staff  169 Mar 14 18:32 Vagrantfile
drwxr-xr-x  5 Kevin  staff  170 Mar 11 12:30 files
drwxr-xr-x  3 Kevin  staff  102 Mar 11 12:31 manifests
```

The only thing in `manifests` is `default.pp`.

I adapted an example from [`patrickdlee`](https://github.com/patrickdlee/vagrant-examples/tree/master/example5) for the `default.pp` manifest (thanks, dude). I wanted to simplify the setup with a single file, so here is the full source:

```ruby
stage { 'pre':
  before => Stage['main']
}

# add the baseconfig module to the new 'pre' run stage
class { 'baseconfig':
  stage => 'pre'
}

# set defaults for file ownership/permissions
File {
  owner => 'root',
  group => 'root',
  mode  => '0644',
}

class baseconfig {
  exec { 'apt-get update':
    command => '/usr/bin/apt-get update';
  }
}

class mysql {
  package { ['mysql-server']:
    ensure => present,
  }

  service { 'mysql':
    ensure  => running,
    require => Package['mysql-server'],
  }

  file { '/etc/mysql/my.cnf':
    source  => '/vagrant/files/my.cnf',
    require => Package['mysql-server'],
    notify  => Service['mysql'],
  }

  exec { 'set-mysql-password':
    unless  => 'mysqladmin -uroot -proot status',
    command => "mysqladmin -uroot password root",
    path    => ['/bin', '/usr/bin'],
    require => Service['mysql'],
  }

  exec { 'load-dynamic-sql':
    command => 'mysql -u root -proot < /vagrant/files/dynamic.sql',
    path    => ['/bin', '/usr/bin'],
    require => Exec['set-mysql-password'],
  }

  file { '/tmp/permissions.sh':
    source => '/vagrant/files/permissions.sh',
    mode   => '755',
    require => Exec['load-dynamic-sql'],
  }

  exec { 'grant-access':
    command => '/tmp/permissions.sh',
    path    => ['/bin', '/usr/bin'],
    require => File['/tmp/permissions.sh'],
  }
}

include baseconfig, mysql
```

Note that the `baseconfig` does an `apt-get` to ensure the image is up to date.

The file consists of a series of configurations or commands, organized into classes. From my understanding, a class is just an organizational unit: it doesn't imply anything else one might infer from use in object oriented programming.

Each configuration is a "resource" declaration. For the `file` resource above, `/tmp/permissions.sh` is the resource "title". So the "type" of the resource is `file`, the "title" is `/tmp/permissions.sh` and `source` and `mode` are "attributes". Each attribute is separated by a comma. Similarly, `mysql-server` is a package and we're telling Puppet to ensure it's it's "present" (installed).

I would like to draw your attention to the `require` declarations in most of these. Puppet does not by default assume any ordering, but you can [configure it to do so](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/lang_summary.html#ordering).

Moving on to the `files` directory, we have:

```
>ls -l
total 32
-rw-r--r--  1 Kevin  staff  1039 Mar 10 21:30 dynamic.sql
-rw-r--r--  1 Kevin  staff  4156 Mar 10 21:30 my.cnf
-rw-r--r--@ 1 Kevin  staff   222 Mar 11 09:18 permissions.sh
```

The `permissions.sh` file performs grants for the MySQL user and `dynamic.sql` creates the tables, etc.

The `my.cnf` is the MySQL configuration file to use for the MySQL install. The approach to setting up this file varies among the tools as well.

Finally, I'll compare the startup time for provisioning the Vagrant instance with Puppet vs. the shell provisioner. The first time up, this is what it takes on my Mac:

```
real	1m54.632s
user	0m4.114s
sys	0m1.792s
```

After a `vagrant halt`, the next `vagrant up` took:


```
real	0m21.751s
user	0m3.216s
sys	0m1.263s
```

That's about the same as using the shell provisioner from last time.

## Summary

Overall, I found the language relatively easy to understand. I wouldn't call it intuitive, however. To me, with its braces, colons and comma-separated values, it feels much more like a programming language than the YAML-based configurations used by Ansible and Salt. I don't know if that's necessarily bad, and there are bound to be tradeoffs. I find the YAML-based configurations easier to use, but perhaps less extensible.

There is a lot of information available on Puppet and the [Puppet docs](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/) are pretty good (navigation perhaps being the less than optimal but not terrible).

Puppet seems to have the most mind share of any of these tools as well based on my Googling and some discussions with industry analysis, but things are changing so fast, that too may change quickly.

I think if you don't mind the language, it's a pretty good choice for configuring Vagrant.
