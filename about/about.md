I'm a software developer. For most of my career I've focused on large scale transactional systems, both as an architect and developer.

These days I have some flexibility. I'm placing more value on interesting work. I'm interested in learning new things, helping out interesting teams and loving what I do. Especially that last thing.

If you have an interesting project or a startup and want to talk about it, use the form below. If you're in the Dallas area, maybe we could get a beer.
