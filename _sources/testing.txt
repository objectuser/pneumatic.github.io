Unit Testing
============

ETL jobs are traditionally challenging to test. Often, the entire job must be tested as a unit, which makes it difficult to find errors and more cumbersome to setup some kinds of test cases.

Pneumatic makes unit testing possible, easy and effective. Individual filters in a job can be isolated for unit testing either using traditional Java unit testing frameworks (e.g., JUnit) or using the built in declarative unit testing facility.
