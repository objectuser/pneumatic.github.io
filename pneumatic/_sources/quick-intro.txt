Pneumatic.IO is a fresh approach to ETL and structured IO. It's a development platform, but little to no programming is required.

Pneumatic is declarative, using either a custom YAML markup, or XML markup based on Spring's support for extensible markup. I hope in the future there will be a GUI for creating Pneumatic jobs. But for now, the textual forms provide a proof of concept that still makes creating ETL jobs really easy.

As a quick example, here's how you might read from a file and write its contents to a database.

Next, here are the YAML-based Pneumatic declarations. Generally, the first line of a declaration is the item's "identifier" (like ``mtbSchema``), optionally followed by a YAML tag indicating the type of the item (``!schema`` means this item is of the ``schema`` type). If the item is named according to Pneumatci convention, the type tag may be omitted. For example, because ``mtbSchema`` ends in ``Schema`` Pneumatic knows it's a schema.::

  # Declare a schema that defines our records
  mtbSchema:
    name: Input Schema
    columns:
      - name: name
        type: string
      - name: year
        type: integer
      - name: cost
        type: decimal
  
  # Declare a pipe to join the file reader and database writer
  fileReaderOutput:
  # Declare a file reader to read from mtb.txt
  mtbFileReader:
    name: File Reader
    fileResource: data/mtb.txt
    output: fileReaderOutput # reference to fileReaderOutput
    outputSchema: mtbSchema # reference to mtbSchema
  
  # Declare a database writer to read from the pipe and write to the mtb table
  mtbDatabaseWriter:
    name: Database Writer
    input: fileReaderOutput
    inputSchema: mtbSchema
    dataSource: dataSource # Reference the data source declared in Spring XML
    insertInto: mtb

Visually, the job looks like this:

The schema declaration (``mtbSchema``) is used to declare the structure of records in the job. A pipe (``fileReaderOutput``) provides a conduit from one processing element (called "filters") to another.

A file reader (``mtbFileReader``) reads a file, creating records according to its schema (``outputSchema: mtbSchema``) and sending them to the pipe referenced in its ``output``.

A database writer (``mtbDatabaseWriter``) writes records from the pipe referenced in its ``input`` to a table available in the data source: the ``mtb`` table referenced in the ``insertInto`` property in this case. The data source is specified using the Spring framework::

  <jdbc:embedded-database id="dataSource" type="HSQL" />

Declaring these elements provides Pneumatic enough information to read all the records in the file and write them to the database. When there are no more records to process, Pneumatic shuts down. That's it.
