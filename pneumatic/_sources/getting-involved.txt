Pneumatic would benefit from wider expertise than I have. Here are some thoughts on the kinds of expertise that would really benefit Pneumatic:

* ETL expertise to drive a direction on enhancing functionality to benefit more use cases
* Spring namespace expertise for creating a top-level ETL namespace and removing the need for the ``etl:`` prefix for everything
* Eclipse expertise to get the XML element help to show up in Eclipse editors
* Java developers for enhancements, defect resolution and better test coverage
* Anyone that wants to enhance the documentation
* Anyone with samples, examples, etc
* Smart people with ideas!
