XML File Reader
---------------

The XML file reader reads records from an XML document. It should be considered experimental. (Is it really useful to read records this way? If you think so, let me know!) There is no DSL for this filter. To get a feel for it, look at the ``xml-test.xml`` sample.

(If you have an idea on how to better support XML in Pneumatic.IO, let me know!)
