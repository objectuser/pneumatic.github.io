Pneumatic is in the "proof of concept" stage of development. It can already do very useful things, but I recommend you be conservative in your uses of it. With your feedback, however, it should progress to wider usage scenarios quickly. I encourage you to try it out and provide your feedback on the official forum.

Jobs and Filters
================

Pneumatic "programs" are represented as "jobs". Jobs read from files, from databases, from services and write to those same things. They transform data, join it, filter it, aggregate it and more.

The reading, writing, transforming, etc. are done in "filters". Filters are connected through pipes that carry the data from one filter to the next. This `pipes and filters <http://www.eaipatterns.com/PipesAndFilters.html>`_ architecture is widely-known. It's conceptually simple, yet quite powerful, and is the fundamental pattern of Pneumatic jobs.

It looks a bit like this:

Scale this out with more pipes connecting more filters and you get the picture of the architecture of Pneumatic.IO. Simple concepts form powerful jobs.

These concepts are fundamental, but the words "job" and "filter" don't often appear in Pneumatic configurations. But as we discuss Pneumatic in this guide, we will use those terms, so you still need to understand them. 

Running a Job
-------------

Jobs may be run in a variety of ways. The easiest way to run a job is using the "Pneumatic Shell" (``pn.sh`` on most systems or ``pn.cmd`` on Windows). The file ``pn.sh`` is in the ``pneumatic-samples`` project on `GitHub <https://github.com/objectuser/pneumatic>`_.

If your job is contained in ``job.xml``, run it like this::

  sh pn.sh run job.xml

If you have, for example, RESTful services provided by your job, use the Spring Boot runner::

  sh pn.sh boot job.xml

The boot runner will stay resident until Spring Boot shuts down.

Using the script is easy, but it does quite a few things. The script uses `Gradle <http://gradle.org/>`_ to:

#. download the latest version of Gradle
#. compile Pneumatic.IO
#. run the job

The first two are only done if necessary: if Gradle has already been downloaded, or Pnematic is already built, it won't do these things again.

Gradle and Pnematic.IO are both dependent on a Java runtime on your system, which is `available from Oracle <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>`_. Pneumatic is currently compiled to Java 8.

Schemas
=======

Schemas describe the structure of data. Filters use schemas for validating and generating structured data in the form of "records". A record may be thought of as an "instance" of a schema. A schema is to a record like a car is to a 2015 Porsche 911.

From the previous example, a schema is defined using the ``schema`` tag. A schema may have one to any number of columns, each with a name and a type. Currently, Pneumatic only supports ``string`` (Java String), ``integer`` (Java Integer) and ``decimal`` (Java Double) column types::

  mtbSchema: !schema
    name: Input Schema
    columns:
      - name: name
        type: string
      - name: year
        type: integer
      - name: cost
        type: decimal

If a record does not need to be validated or generated, no schema is required by the filter. An example of this is the copy filter which copies the input records to the configured outputs, unmodified.

Sometimes a schema is optional. If the schema is not provided, information is derived from other configuration or runtime elements (like the structure of the incoming record). If the schema is supplied, it can be used to validate the configuration of the filter. This requires slightly more configuration, but schema information in validated before a job starts, so supplying a schema can save time spent processing with an invalid configuration.

Schema Types
------------

There are three types of schemas:

* Tabular schemas - (``schema``) represent traditional (i.e., database like) schemas with fixed columns and data types.
* XML schemas (experimental) - (``xmlSchema``) represent schemas for XML documents based on the XML Schema Definition. XML schemas work in some cases but are experimental at this point.
* JSON schemas (experimental) - (``jsonSchema``) represent schemas for JSON documents based on http://json-schema.org/.

Pipes
=====

Pipes are conduits for data. Pipes hold data after it is processed by a filter, until it is extracted by another filter. Pipes have a fixed (and configurable) capacity. When the capacity is reached, a filter putting a record into a pipe will block until the filter on the other end of the pipe removes a record.

Foundations
===========

Pneumatic leverages `Spring <http://spring.io/>`_ projects whenever possible, and that's quite often. There are areas where Pneumatic diverges from some frameworks like `Spring Batch <http://projects.spring.io/spring-batch/>`_. In the future, it is possible that Pneumatic will be more closely aligned with this project and possibly others.

There are enormous benefits from leveraging Spring. Some of these are:

* The use of quality, tested frameworks and components that don't have to be reinvented.
* The extensible XML markup that makes for an easy to use DSL while enabling massive extensibility.
* The ability to extend the framework by creating Spring beans and wiring them to ETL components.
* The ability to test portions of a job in a way that more closely aligns with traditional unit testing.
